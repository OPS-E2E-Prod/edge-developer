> With this announcement, Microsoft is no longer accepting new Extensions for the current version of Microsoft Edge.  If you own an Extension in the current version, you should begin the process of porting your Extension to the new Microsoft Edge so your customers are not face interruptions as they upgrade.  Also note that because the new Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium, Extensions designed for the current version of Microsoft Edge do not work with the new version.
